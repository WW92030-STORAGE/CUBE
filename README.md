# CUBE
Rubik's Cube Solver

This program is designed to run on a small amount of memory (about 200ish KB), so large graph searches (such as IDA*) are not feasible here. Currently we use a simplified version of the Fridrich (CFOP) method. It's somewhere between the Beginner's Method (LBL) and true CFOP.

# TODO (In no particular order)

- Implement more special cases and more optimized solutions for F2L.
